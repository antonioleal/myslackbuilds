## zutty (X terminal emulator using OpenGL ES Compute Shaders)
 Zutty is a terminal emulator for the X Window System, functionally
 similar to several other X terminal emulators such as xterm, rxvt and
 countless others. It is also similar to other, much more modern,
 GPU-accelerated terminal emulators such as Alacritty and Kitty. What
 really sets Zutty apart is its radically simple, yet extremely
 efficient rendering implementation.
