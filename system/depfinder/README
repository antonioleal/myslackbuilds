depfinder (finds dependencies of Slackware packages)

depfinder is a tool that finds the dependencies of Slackware
packages and outputs them in a comma separated list, in stdout or a
.dep file. depfinder is very fast at calculating dependencies; the
speed difference mainly comes from the C++ code that is used to find
in which package each individual library is included. That C++ code is
'borrowed' (as in blatanly ripped) from Nigel Bosch's zpm code.
depfinder also has support for running multiple jobs which makes it a
"*lot* faster on PCs with multiple CPUs/cores.
