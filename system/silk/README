Silk is a frontend for slapt-get and slapt-src.
It implements the more common commands and simplifies the operation
of both programs by unifying the syntax and their execution.

usage examples:

    sl u          --> update cache
    sl U          --> upgrade installed programs and slackbuilds
    sl s 'name'   --> search for a package or slackbuild 'name'
    sl i 'name'   --> install 'name'
    sl r 'name'   --> remove name

Note: 'sl' is a symlink to 'silk'.

This program conflicts with the 'sl' package found in SlackBuilds.org,
do not install both at the same time
