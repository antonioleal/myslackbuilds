qt6 (Qt GUI toolkit, version 6)

Qt6 is a complete and well-developed object-oriented framework for
developing graphical user interface (GUI) applications using C++.

This build does not use LLVM, instead just uses the standard
Slackware packages and is therefore incomplete, but enough
to compile allmost all packages that require Qt6.
