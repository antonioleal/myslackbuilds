*No longer feasible to update with stock Slackware 15.0, unless you install Qt Libraries version 6.2.4, on your own or using SBo:

*In order to install Qt package from SBo you need first to register for a Qt account (free), install the package qt-install-script (available on Slackbuilds.org) and from it run qt-6.2.4-libraries-for-musescore.sh. After that you can proceed to install the latest MuseScore (this package).*
