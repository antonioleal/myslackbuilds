Silk is a practical frontend to various slackware package management
tools, namely slackpkg, sbopkg, slapt-get, slapt-src.
It implements the more common commands and simplifies the operation
of both programs by unifying the syntax and their execution.

Please add your user to sudoers in order to use the program.

usage examples:

  sl u         --> update&upgrade installed programs and slackbuilds
  sl s 'name'  --> search for a package or slackbuild 'name'
  sl i 'name'  --> install 'name'
  sl r 'name   --> remove name

Note: 'sl' and 'slapt' are symlinks to 'silk'. Use them at will.

This program conflicts with the 'sl' package found in SlackBuilds.org,
do not install both at the same time.

An launcher in installed in the programs menu that runs silk-shell,
which streamlines operations.
