qt6-location (Qt GUI toolkit, version 6, qtlocation)

Qt6 is a complete and well-developed object-oriented framework for
developing graphical user interface (GUI) applications using C++.

This build uses GCC instead of LLVM, but it does use cmake-opt,
available on SlackBuilds.org.
The goal is to have an updated but minimised qt6 build, where
users can select which packages are realy needed.
